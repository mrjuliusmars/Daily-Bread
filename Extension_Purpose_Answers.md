**What's your app's primary purpose?**

```
Daily Bread helps users manage their personal device usage by automatically blocking distracting apps (social media, games, etc.) at scheduled times. Users must read a daily Bible verse to unlock their apps, encouraging spiritual reflection and intentional device use.

This Device Activity Monitor Extension is essential for the app's core functionality. It uses the Device Activity framework in the Screen Time API to automatically apply shields to selected apps when the user's scheduled blocking time begins. Without this extension, users cannot benefit from automatic scheduled app blocking, which is the primary feature that enables personal device usage management and spiritual growth.

**Shorter version (if character limit):**

```
This extension enables automatic scheduled app blocking for personal device usage management. Users set a daily schedule (e.g., 4:20 PM), and the extension uses the Device Activity framework to automatically block distracting apps at that time, requiring users to read a Bible verse to unlock. This helps users prioritize spiritual reflection over social media and distractions.

**What's your app's primary purpose?**

```
Daily Bread helps users manage their personal device usage by automatically blocking distracting apps at scheduled times. Users must read a daily Bible verse to unlock their apps, encouraging spiritual reflection.

This Shield Configuration Extension provides custom UI for the shield screen that appears when apps are blocked. Instead of showing generic iOS restriction messages, it displays branded, contextually relevant messaging that guides users to read Bible verses ("Your Daily Bread Awaits" with spiritual messaging). This enhances the user experience by reinforcing the app's spiritual purpose and helping users understand why their apps are blocked and what action they need to take.
