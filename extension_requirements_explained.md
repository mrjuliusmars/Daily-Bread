# Why Extensions Need Separate Targets & App IDs

## Short Answer:
**You CANNOT avoid separate targets** - iOS requires them. However, you might NOT need separate approval requests if the extensions can inherit from the main app's provisioning profile.

---

## Why Separate Targets Are REQUIRED (Not Optional)

### iOS Architecture Requirement
These extension points **MUST** be separate targets because:

1. **Device Activity Monitor Extension**
   - iOS calls this extension directly when a `DeviceActivitySchedule` triggers
   - Your main app cannot respond to these system events
   - Must implement `DeviceActivityMonitor` class in a separate extension target
   - Extension Point: `com.apple.deviceactivity.monitor-extension`

2. **Shield Configuration Extension**
   - iOS calls this extension directly to render shield UI
   - Your main app cannot provide shield configuration at runtime
   - Must implement `ShieldConfigurationDataSource` in a separate extension target
   - Extension Point: `com.apple.ManagedSettingsUI.shield-configuration-service`

**You literally cannot implement this functionality in your main app.** iOS won't call your main app for these events.

## Why Separate Bundle Identifiers (App IDs) Are REQUIRED

Each extension MUST have its own bundle identifier:
- Main App: `com.mjhventures.dailybread`
- Monitor: `com.mjhventures.dailybread.Daily-Bread-Monitor`
- Shield Config: `com.mjhventures.dailybread.Daily-Bread-Shield-Configuration`

This is an iOS bundle identifier rule - extensions cannot share the main app's bundle ID.

## Do They Need SEPARATE Approval Requests?

### The Good News:
They might **inherit** from the main app during **archiving**, even if they show as "Development only" in Xcode.

### How Automatic Signing Works:
1. When you archive, Xcode creates a **combined provisioning profile** that includes:
   - Main app (`com.mjhventures.dailybread`)
   - All embedded extensions
   - Their shared capabilities

2. If the main app has Family Controls (Distribution), the archive might succeed even if extensions show "Development only" in Xcode

3. The extensions get their capabilities from the **embedded app bundle**, not independent App IDs

---

## Why You're Seeing "Development Only"

Xcode shows "Family Controls (Development)" for extensions because:
- It's checking each App ID **individually** in Developer Portal
- But during **actual archiving**, they inherit from the main app's profile

---

## Solution Options:

### Option 1: Try Archiving Anyway (Test First)
Even if Xcode shows "Development only" for extensions, try:
1. Clean build folder
2. Archive the app
3. See if it succeeds or fails

**If it succeeds:** You don't need separate approval! The extensions inherit from main app.

**If it fails with specific provisioning errors:** Then you need separate approvals.

### Option 2: Enable Capability on Extension App IDs (Developer Portal Only)
1. Go to Apple Developer Portal â†’ Identifiers
2. For each extension App ID, **enable** "Family Controls" capability
3. **Save** (don't need approval request - just enable it)
4. Regenerate provisioning profiles
5. Try archiving again

**Note:** Just enabling the capability in the portal might be enough without a separate approval request, since the main app is already approved.

### Option 3: Contact Apple (Only if Options 1 & 2 Fail)
Only submit approval requests if:
- Archive fails with specific provisioning errors
- Enabling capability in portal doesn't work
- Apple rejects the archive during App Store submission

---

## Testing Strategy:

1. **First:** Try archiving right now (ignore the "Development only" warnings)
2. **If archive succeeds:** You're done! Extensions inherit from main app.
3. **If archive fails:** Enable Family Controls capability on extension App IDs in Developer Portal
4. **If still fails:** Then submit approval requests

---

## Bottom Line:

- **Separate targets:** Unavoidable (iOS requirement)
- **Separate App IDs:** Unavoidable (bundle identifier rules)
- **Separate approvals:** Might be avoidable (extensions may inherit from main app)

Try archiving first before requesting separate approvals!
