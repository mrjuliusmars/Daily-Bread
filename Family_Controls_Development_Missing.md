# Why "Family Controls (Development)" Might Not Appear

## Possible Explanations:

### 1. **Distribution Includes Development (Most Likely)**
For managed capabilities like Family Controls, Apple may have changed the system so that:
- **Distribution approval = Both Distribution AND Development access**
- You only see "Family Controls (Distribution)" because it covers both
- No separate "Development" option needed

### 2. **Requires Approval First**
- Development might only appear after you've been approved
- Since you have Distribution approval, Development might be automatically included
- Try building/testing - it might work!

### 3. **Portal Update/Display Issue**
- Apple's portal sometimes doesn't show all available options
- The capability might be enabled but not displayed separately
- Check if it works in practice

## What to Do:

### Option 1: Try It (Recommended)
Since you have Distribution enabled, **try building and testing**:
1. Clean build folder in Xcode
2. Build and run on your device
3. Test the scheduled blocking at 2:10 PM
4. Check Console.app logs

**If it works:** Distribution includes Development! âœ…

**If it doesn't work:** See Option 2

### Option 2: Check Main App
If the extension doesn't work, check if your **main app** (`com.mjhventures.dailybread`) has:
- Family Controls (Development) enabled
- Extensions might inherit Development from the main app

### Option 3: Contact Apple (If It Doesn't Work)
If testing fails, contact Apple Developer Support:
- Explain you have Distribution but need Development for testing
- They can clarify if Distribution covers both or if separate approval is needed

## Quick Test:

Try your scheduled blocking at 2:10 PM. If the Monitor extension triggers and apps block automatically, then Distribution works for development! ðŸŽ‰
